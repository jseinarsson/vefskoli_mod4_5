# Javascript - Modules, Package Managers and Bundlers

This project uses a module that can be imported into a project that creates a little UFO following your mouse, and package to bundle it.

* You can see a live version of it here: [live demo](https://youthful-euclid-01563a.netlify.app)
* It can also be installed using NPM, see here: [ufo-cursor on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ufo-cursor) (Heads up, the installation should be `npm i ufo-cursor --save`)
